# Spool_Builder_Swarm_Simulator
Source code for "An interactive simulation of control and coordination strategies for swarms of autonomous construction robots" by Jordan H Boyle

The code should run as is, provided you have Python and the necessary modules installed.

Hopefully you can figure out how it works through a combination of the comments, the variable / function names and the description in the paper.

Good luck!
